# 📄 Rule: Dynamic Form-Driven UI with File Upload Support

## System Overview

You are building a no-code admin dashboard powered by Supabase. Each form is defined by a row in the `public.forms` table, where a JSON configuration describes how to render and validate input fields. These forms dynamically handle creating and editing records in various tables, such as `articles`, and now include **file upload support** via a separate table: `forms.files`.

---

## ✅ File Upload Field Rule

When a field in the JSON schema has `"type": "file"`, it triggers the system to:

1. Render a file upload UI in the form.
2. Upload the file to Supabase Storage using the specified `bucket` and `storage_path`.
3. Save a record in `forms.files` linking the uploaded file to the parent record (`articles`, etc.).

### Example JSON Field

```json
{
  "acl": "public",
  "name": "header_url",
  "type": "file",
  "label": "Header Image",
  "bucket": "article-assets",
  "validations": ["file", "image"],
  "storage_path": "public/articles/header_images"
}

📂 forms.files Table (PostgreSQL SQL Migration)

create schema if not exists forms;

create table if not exists forms.files (
  id bigserial primary key,
  resource_id uuid not null,
  resource_table_name text not null,
  field_name text not null,

  bucket text not null,
  path text not null,
  acl text default 'public',

  filename text not null,
  mime_type text,
  size bigint,

  metadata jsonb,

  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

create index on forms.files (resource_id, resource_table_name);
create index on forms.files (field_name);

🔄 Route Behavior (Next.js Layout)

/forms
	•	List of all available form configurations from public.forms.
	•	Each form row shows:
	•	name
	•	table_name
	•	[Edit Form] button
	•	[View All Records] → /forms/[table_name]/all

⸻

/forms/[table_name]/all
	•	Fetches and displays all records in the given table.
	•	Uses JSON config from public.forms to:
	•	Determine which columns to show
	•	Display an Edit button per row: /forms/[table_name]/[record_id]/edit

⸻

/forms/[table_name]/[record_id]/edit
	•	Dynamically renders a form for editing a single record.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Get the form JSON where table_name = [table_name]
	2.	Get the record where id = [record_id]
	3.	Fetch any matching forms.files by resource_id and field_name
	4.	Render inputs for fields (text, select, file, etc.)
	5.	On submit, update both:
	•	The table record
	•	The file list (new uploads go into forms.files, old ones can be marked or deleted)

⸻

🎯 Future Features
	•	🆕 Form builder for creating/editing form JSON (/forms/new)
	•	✅ Auto-create buckets if missing
	•	🖼️ File previews for image uploads
	•	🗑️ Soft delete or version control in forms.files

⸻

💡 Pro Tip

All file uploads are related to content by:
	•	resource_id → the UUID of the related record
	•	resource_table_name → e.g., articles
	•	field_name → e.g., header_url, images

This allows multiple file fields per resource, all cleanly managed via metadata.
